    	</h1>
    	<p> I began rowing while I was an undergraduate in 2014 at the University of St Andrews. I walked on to the team, thinking that it would be a short lived experiment and avenue to meet new people. Little did I know it would be where I found my niche and community. I rowed for the university on teh Senior Women's squad, competing in both open and lightweight events at the Championship level.

    	<p>After graduating from St Andrews in 2017, I joined the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pbcsculling/"> Potomac Boat Club Open Scullers</a> program in Washington, D.C. In 2018, I was a part of the original eight that formed the re-launched PBC Women's Sweep Team.

    	<p> In 2018, I left D.C. to pursue a Masters degree at the University of Virginia. While in Charlottesville, I joined the Virginia Rowing Association, the UVA men's rowing team, as a coxswain and sculler.
    	</p>
    	<p> After a brief hiatus from training due to herniated discs in my neck, I got back into the boat in the fall of 2019. These days I can be found in both sculling and sweep boats with the Open Scullers and Women's Sweep team.
